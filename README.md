## Databases

### UCLA Center for Health Policy Research Elder Index Database

The Elder Index was first created in Boston by Wider Opportunities for Women (WOW). Then, in 2007, the UCLA Center For Health Policy developed the Elder Economic Security Standard™ Index for California as part of WOW's Elder Economic Security Initiative™. It is an index developed by expert gerontologists to better assess senior economic insecurity and poverty, providing locality-specific measures of basic needs costs for elders of different family types. It was calculated "based on local market rates for housing, food, care, transportation, and other basic necessities." The family types included in the database include:

Single Elder & Elder Couple	
Single and Elder Couple Raising Grandchildren Only	
Single and Elder Couple Housing Adult Children Only	
Single and Elder Couple Housing Adult Children & Grandchildren	
Single and Elder Couple Living with Adult Children Only	
Single and Elder Couple Living with Adult Children & Grandchildren	

The index utilizes credible, publicly available data.
